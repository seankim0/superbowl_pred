# Super Bowl Winner Prediction Model

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict the winner of the Super Bowl. It analyzes various team and game-related data, leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms to make the final prediction.

## Code Overview

The core code of this project is contained in the 'SuperBowl\_Prediction\_2024\_v6\_250106.ipynb' file. The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load raw data and perform data cleaning.
   - Handle missing values and engineer features.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):**
   - Analyze data distributions and correlations.
   - Identify key patterns through visualizations.
3. **Feature Selection and Model Building:**
   - Select meaningful variables and train the model.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
4. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize confusion matrices and ROC curves.
5. **Results Analysis and Prediction:**
   - Summarize the model performance and present prediction results.

## Usage

1. Set up an environment that supports Jupyter Notebook (e.g., Anaconda, VS Code, Google Colab).
2. Open the 'SuperBowl\_Prediction\_2024\_v6\_250106.ipynb' file.
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. requirements.txtExecute the code cells in order to train the model and review the results.
